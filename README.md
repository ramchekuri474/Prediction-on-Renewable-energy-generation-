        <td> The Main aim of this project isto Predict the Renewable(Solar,Wind) power generation on daily basis andthe load usage of this power generation and Renewable energy is a revolutionary topic today, dwindling the usage of non-renewable energy is the main concern.   Every organization working on analyzing the data on renewable energy for further use, or to increase supply. I have  analyzed PJM region energy load, which helps organizations by enabling them to recognize the patterns in the data, and by showing insights into untapped information.  I have took the  advantage of different forecasting models to forecast energy usage hourly, where FB-Prophet has shown promising results. I have considered 4 years of historical data for training and testing purpose. PJM has provided us with abundance of historical data, which helped me to work on model.</td>
